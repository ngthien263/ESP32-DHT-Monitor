# ESP32 DHT22 Monitoring System

A modular sensor monitoring system built with ESP-IDF and FreeRTOS, following clean architecture principles and observer design pattern.

---

## üß± Architecture Overview

- **Sensor Layer:** DHT22 driver (1-wire protocol) periodically samples temperature and humidity.
- **Subject Layer:** Implements observer pattern (subscribe, notify).
- **Observer Layer:** Includes logger, HTTP client, and optionally LCD display.
- **Communication:** Uses FreeRTOS primitives ‚Äî `mutex`, `event group`, `queue` ‚Äî to synchronize data flow.

üëâ See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for full architecture description.
